1. Locks is when each resource that a thread uses has a lock so that only one thread has access to that
    resource at a time. Mutex is when you put up a restriction around a critical section of a resource to
    prevent data races. Semaphores are just variables to control access to a commonly used resource. It
    keeps track of how many units or a resource are available to use. Synchronized uses synchronized
    blocks that are marked with a keyword. When a block is on an object no other threads are allowed
    to use that object until the thread using the object leaves. Volatile is put onto a variable which
    tells all threads to do read and write operations on main memory only. Atomic can be put on variables
    so some operations cannot be preformed on them by threads.

2. Deadlock is when a set of processes are blocked because each of them are holding a resource and waiting
    for the other process to let go of their resources to use.

3. A race condition is when a device or system tries to do the same operation at the same time or when
    two threads try to access a shared variable at the same time.

4. It is when a program does not release memory of an object that is no longer in use or if that object
    is stored in memory but can't be accessed.

5. An ANR is activity non responsive. It is thrown when an activity gor unresponsive for 5 seconds
    or a broadcast receiver does not finish reception of a broadcast in ten seconds. Common causes are
    memory leaks or the main thread gets too full so it cant send signals.
